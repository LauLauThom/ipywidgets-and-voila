This is a demo repository demonstrating interactive plotting with ipywidgets and matplotlib.   
The notebook can also be rendered into an interactive webapp with the package voila (or the newer voici).  
You can run the notebooks in this repo from your browser using Binder (click the badge above).  
To run locally, install the packages defined in requirements, then call the following command in a terminal, opened in this directory.  
`voila path/to/notebook.ipynb`

A short presentation can also be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16N_HQmpNut_S_9qeQ5TC--2KMMZBrlvw_4ILf-JPDoE/edit?usp=sharing).  
The link will probably die at some point but the presentation is in the repo as a pdf.
